# Sillish

Random stuff I write down to become less dumb and to remember what I worked on. Mostly tech related.

I should have started this months ago, but better late than never.

## Why "Sillish"?

Sillish is a word I made up that means "silly" but with an "ish" suffix. I often find myself dumb but I try to be less and less so every day. Hence, Sillish. Not dumbish because I didn't like the sound of that.
